    <p>Jinwoo is a handsome and muscular young man with gray eyes, black hair, and sharp facial features. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright purple. He is almost always seen wearing dark colors, particularly black, and after slaughtering the Monarchs for a second time, takes to wearing a black glove on his left hand, which was severely scarred in his battle with Antares.</p>
    <p>Back when he was weak, Jinwoo was a short, scrawny young man with hair long enough to completely cover his ears. His face was also very boyish, which made him look even younger than his sister Jinah, and he tended to dress in a simple blue hoodie and jeans.</p>
